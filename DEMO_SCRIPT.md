> "The **Orchestrator** coordinates everything. The **Monitor Agent** watches every transaction in real-time. The **Analyzer** decompiles bytecode and runs static analysis. The **Threat Intel Agent** compares patterns against 500+ historical exploits using vector embeddings."
>
> "When a critical threat is detected, the **Response Agent** automatically pauses the contract and alerts the team. And the **Learning Agent**? It makes the system smarter after every incident."
>
> "All powered by **8 custom MCP tools** - from bytecode analysis to mempool monitoring to semantic exploit search."

### On-Screen Text (Overlay)

>
> "But watch this one - **72 out of 100**. High risk. The AI agents are actively monitoring it."
>
> "On the right, the **live incident feed** shows real-time detections via WebSockets. Every anomaly, every threat, streaming instantly."
>
> "Down here, all five AI agents are healthy and operational - each with their own activity metrics."

### On-Screen Text
- Highlight risk scores
- Point out WebSocket connection indicator

>
> "**9 seconds** - Response Agent executes emergency pause. **Transaction confirmed**."
>
> "The contract is now frozen. Discord and Telegram alerts sent. Incident logged permanently onchain."
>
> "Look at the dashboard - the incident appears in real-time with full details: contract address, threat type, risk score 95, and the AI agent that detected it."

### On-Screen Text
- Timeline overlay: "3s → 5s → 7s → 9s → PAUSED"

### Narration
> "Now, you might be thinking: 'That's a lot of power for an AI.' And you're right."
>
> "That's why CodeGuard is **governed by the community**. The agent can pause contracts, but it can't access funds. There's a **1-hour veto window** where the DAO can override any decision."
>
> "To resume a contract? **24-hour timelock** plus DAO approval required."
>
> "This is **decentralized AI** done right - autonomous but accountable."
